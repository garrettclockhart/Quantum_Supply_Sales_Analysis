## Recommendations

### Advertising
- **Create a marketing campaign that can recapture lost customers who bought items in 2020 and 2021** when sales were the highest. If a customer has already purchased from the platform, they are more likely to purchase again and need to be retargeted for potential future purchases.

### Refunds
- **Look further into what is causing the Macbooks to be returned twice as often as AirPods,** additionally locate the return data for 2022 transactions. 
- **Invest more into marketing the loyalty program and create more incentives for customers to join the program,** Loyalty members take less time to make their first purchase after creating an account, and on average spend more than non-loyalty members. 

### Products
- **Increase the number of products that can be sold in the Gaming Monitor and Laptop categories** as only 3 types products make up the majority of sales for the platform. For example offering keyboards, headsets, mice, microphones in that category to increase potential add-on purchases.
- **During surges of demand offer slight discounts to purchases and bundles made on the platform for popular products,** this can increase profit as the volume of sales will make up for the reduction in price.

### Regions
- **Investigate potential growth opportunities in APAC and LATAM regions** examples could include offering region specific products or conduct more research into the needs of the region.
